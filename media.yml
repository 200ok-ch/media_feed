  - title: libusb Maintainer fail - How I failed to run an open source project

      In 2010 I was asked by the second maintainer in a row to take over as new
      maintainer of the libusb project. The first time I had declined. The
      second time I accepted, and sadly failed. Eventually a hostile fork
      emerged, with the explicit goal to take over the original project. I will
      tell you my story, which mistakes I made and what I learned - about
      independent and corporate contributors in open source projects, about
      package maintainers in downstream OS distributions, about trolls on the
      internet, about GitHub Inc. and about myself. The hostile fork? It wasn't
      merged.

      Tino: True lessons everyone involved in OSS will have to learn eventually.

      Did you ever want to have access to a few hundred thousand
      network end points? Or a few hundred thousand phone numbers? A
      short look behind the curtains of how not to do network
      security.

      Alain: Very fun and at the same time horrific talk. Basically everyone
      on a cable network can easily gain access to a root shell on everyone
      elses cable modem. Not only that, you can also listen in to other
      peoples VOIP calls or call from somebody eleses number.

      Horrifying, because it's so simple and extremely powerful.

      In the questions, it's also very interesting at 30:15 when he's being
      asked an easy question and the guy gets very uneasy and says: "The
      problem is the law. I cannot tell you about ....".

      Phil: Best presentation of 32c3 so far!

      Alain: Simon Menner shows a great collection of pictures from the best
      treasure trove that is accessible to us from surveillance
      states. He tells a good story on how absurd and dangerous surveillance
      is at the same time.

      It's also curious to hear that only footage from eastern countries is
      available, the BND only released 14 totally irrelevant pictures of all
      of the cold war (something like a cork screw...). So of course the
      easter states totally look illegal compared to just nothing.

      Giant billboard vans, drone-operated leaflet drops over an NSA
      building and calls to secret service agents, Intelexit explores
      all routes to reach out to secret service agents and convince
      them to follow their conscience and quit their jobs. We will
      take a look at the highlights of the campaign from 2015 and
      what's around the corner for 2016.

      "Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and
      expecting different results."  Albert Einstein - Who did not live long
      enough to see Rowhammer

      Recent studies have found that repeated accesses to DRAM rows
      can cause random bit flips, resulting in the so called Rowhammer
      vulnerability. We present Rowhammer.js, the first remote
      software-induced hardware-fault attack, from JavaScript. We also
      extend our presentation with an overview of cache side-channel
      attacks, that use the same technique to evict data from the
      cache.

      phil: Frightening bit flipping. Very in depth.
