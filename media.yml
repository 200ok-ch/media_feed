      Giant billboard vans, drone-operated leaflet drops over an NSA
      building and calls to secret service agents, Intelexit explores
      all routes to reach out to secret service agents and convince
      them to follow their conscience and quit their jobs. We will
      take a look at the highlights of the campaign from 2015 and
      what's around the corner for 2016.

      "Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and
      expecting different results."  Albert Einstein - Who did not live long
      enough to see Rowhammer

      Recent studies have found that repeated accesses to DRAM rows
      can cause random bit flips, resulting in the so called Rowhammer
      vulnerability. We present Rowhammer.js, the first remote
      software-induced hardware-fault attack, from JavaScript. We also
      extend our presentation with an overview of cache side-channel
      attacks, that use the same technique to evict data from the
      cache.

      phil: Frightening bit flipping. Very in depth.
