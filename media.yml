  - title: libusb Maintainer fail - How I failed to run an open source project

    description: >-
      In 2010 I was asked by the second maintainer in a row to take over as new
      maintainer of the libusb project. The first time I had declined. The
      second time I accepted, and sadly failed. Eventually a hostile fork
      emerged, with the explicit goal to take over the original project. I will
      tell you my story, which mistakes I made and what I learned - about
      independent and corporate contributors in open source projects, about
      package maintainers in downstream OS distributions, about trolls on the
      internet, about GitHub Inc. and about myself. The hostile fork? It wasn't
      merged.

      Tino: True lessons everyone involved in OSS will have to learn eventually.

      Did you ever want to have access to a few hundred thousand
      network end points? Or a few hundred thousand phone numbers? A
      short look behind the curtains of how not to do network
      security.

      Alain: Very fun and at the same time horrific talk. Basically everyone
      on a cable network can easily gain access to a root shell on everyone
      elses cable modem. Not only that, you can also listen in to other
      peoples VOIP calls or call from somebody eleses number.

      Horrifying, because it's so simple and extremely powerful.

      In the questions, it's also very interesting at 30:15 when he's being
      asked an easy question and the guy gets very uneasy and says: "The
      problem is the law. I cannot tell you about ....".

      Phil: Best presentation of 32c3 so far!

      Alain: Simon Menner shows a great collection of pictures from the best
      treasure trove that is accessible to us from surveillance
      states. He tells a good story on how absurd and dangerous surveillance
      is at the same time.

      It's also curious to hear that only footage from eastern countries is
      available, the BND only released 14 totally irrelevant pictures of all
      of the cold war (something like a cork screw...). So of course the
      easter states totally look illegal compared to just nothing.

      "Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and
      expecting different results."  Albert Einstein - Who did not live long
      enough to see Rowhammer

      Recent studies have found that repeated accesses to DRAM rows
      can cause random bit flips, resulting in the so called Rowhammer
      vulnerability. We present Rowhammer.js, the first remote
      software-induced hardware-fault attack, from JavaScript. We also
      extend our presentation with an overview of cache side-channel
      attacks, that use the same technique to evict data from the
      cache.

      phil: Frightening bit flipping. Very in depth.

       Heads is an open source custom firmware and OS configuration for laptops and servers that aims to provide slightly better physical security and protection for data on the system. Unlike Tails, which aims to be a stateless OS that leaves no trace on the computer of its presence, Heads is intended for the case where you need to store data and state on the computer. It targets specific models of commodity hardware and takes advantage of lessons learned from several years of vulnerability research. This talk provides a high level overview of Heads, a demo of installing it on a Thinkpad and a tour of some of the attacks that it protects against.
       about this event: https://c3voc.de
       max: Detailed explanation of heads - a stateful secure linux. Very techical. May be of interest if you try to defend state sponsored actors are very into IT-Security.

       This talk will take an in-depth look at the technical capabilities and vulnerabilities used by Pegasus. We will focus on Pegasus’s features and the exploit chain Pegasus used called Trident. Attendees will learn about Pegasus’s use of 0-days, obfuscation, encryption, function hooking, and its ability to go unnoticed. We will present our detailed technical analysis that covers each payload stage of Pegasus including its exploit chain and the various 0-day vulnerabilities that the toolkit was using to jailbreak a device. After this talk attendees will have learned all of the technical details about Pegasus and Trident and how the vulnerabilities we found were patched.
       about this event: https://c3voc.de

       "Smart" devices using BTLE, a mobile phone and the Internet are becoming more and more popular. We will be using mechanical and electronic hardware attacks, TLS MitM, BTLE sniffing and App decompilation to show why those devices and their manufacturers aren't always that smart after all. And that even AES128 on top of the BTLE layer doesn't have to mean "unbreakable". Our main target will be electronic locks, but the methods shown apply to many other smart devices as well...

       Last year, we demonstrated Linux running on the PS4 in a lightning talk - presented on the PS4 itself. But how did we do it? In a departure from previous Console Hacking talks focusing on security, this year we're going to focus on the PS4 hardware, what makes it different from a PC, and how we reverse engineered it enough to get a full-blown Linux distro running on it, complete with 3D acceleration.
       about this event: https://c3voc.de
       max: Very impressive but also very technical talk about the long way to get linux running on something that is arguable not a PC. If you would like to get into Linux dev or advanced operating systems this might be of interest for you. Otherwise just for some LoLz.

       max: Grossartige Inszenierung einiger Szenen aus dem sog. NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss. Mit verschiedenen Ständigen Berichterstattern sehr hochkarätig besetzt. Ein Lehrstück der Demokratie und der Mühen im Umgang mit Geheimdiensten. Definitiv sehenswert auch für Personen aus dem deutschsprachigen Ausland.
